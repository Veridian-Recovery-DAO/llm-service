# Addiction and Mental Health Recovery LLM Service

## üåü Overview

This project provides an API service powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) trained on addiction recovery and mental health literature. The service is designed to offer psychoeducational support, urge management strategies, and general guidance for individuals seeking recovery. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice or crisis intervention.

The API is built using **FastAPI** and integrates with an LLM backend. It is part of the broader Veridian Recovery DAO initiative, which aims to provide accessible, community-driven resources for addiction and mental health recovery.
